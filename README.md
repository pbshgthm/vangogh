Ever wanted the perfect color palette for a winter evening, cherry blossom, sunset ?

VANGOGH generates color palettes for any search term. It uses Machine learning to generate color palettes from millions of images that are contextually representative.

It offers 4 themes that represent the palettes of the search term and 5 palettes in each theme. If you need a palette from a particular image, checkout Vangogh Image.

Vangogh is an opensource project and contributions are welcome.
